 Stable Distribution (Magic 8.1) Source

    In 2017, Version 8.1 has finally been declared stable enough to supplant version 8.0 
    as the new stable distribution. As with version 8.0 before it, any bugs found will 
    be fixed. However, further development and major code changes will be made to 
    the development distribution version 8.2. The first revision to be called stable 
    is magic-8.1.158.
